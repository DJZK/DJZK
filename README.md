### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**DJZK/DJZK** is the repository for the DJZK bot. This symbolizes me being a DJ, Music Producer, and Sound Engineer first.
DJZK is made from LavaPlayer and JDA4 which depends on Discord API and Discord.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Alfamart Trading Philippines as a IT Support
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more C#... And some deeper Linux knowledge.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: emperorxizzle99@gmail.com, zb.cunanan@alfamart.com.ph
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first programming language was the JS mod for the old Minecraft Pocket Edition
