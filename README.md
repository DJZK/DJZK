### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**DJZK/DJZK** is the repository for the DJZK bot. This symbolizes me being a DJ, Music Producer, and Sound Engineer first.
DJZK is made from LavaPlayer and JDA4 which depends on Discord API and Discord.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currentlya business partner under PC Wise (Wisekider) as a Computer Wizard, and a technical expert.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more C#... And some deeper Linux knowledge.
